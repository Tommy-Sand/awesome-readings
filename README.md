# Awesome Reading List

This is a collection of useful/interesting articles that the UACSS has collected. The list is organized based on a number of systems-centric topics:
- [Low-level Programming](./programming/README.md)
- [Compilers](./compilers/README.md)
- [Operating Systems](./operating-systems/README.md)
- [Computer Architecture](./computer-architecture/README.md)
- [Hardware](./hardware/README.md)

Each folder in this repo corresponds to one of those sections, which are further divided for browsing convenience.

## Submitting new readings

Please submit new readings as you find them. To submit a reading please:
- Make an archive of the resource
    - This can take the form of an internet archive link, a wayback machine link or a file
- Open a PR modifying the relevant `README.md`
- (Optional) if your article comes in the form of a pdf, add it to the `assets` folder in the subdirictory and link it to your entry in the `README.md`
