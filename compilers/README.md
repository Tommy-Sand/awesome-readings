# Compilers Reading List

A discussion of topics on the subject of compilers and programming languages more generally. Naturally there are other reading lists for many of these topics, if you find one you should link it! The main focuses of this particular list are:
- Front-end language development and analysis
- Middle-end machine-independent optimizations
- Back-end machine-dependent optimizations
- Code generation
- JIT compilers
- Non-compiled programming languages and utilities
    - Garbage collection
    - Efficient interpreters

As we gain more resources we can expand that list.

## Additional Reading Lists
- [CDOL Reading List](https://jnamaral.github.io/CDOL/) - J. Nelson Amaral's Lab reading list, covers a number of topics ranging from classic optimization passes to code placement optimization to code analysis and working with that information.

## Garbage Collection
- [A Unified Garbage Collection](./assets/unified_garbage_collection.pdf) Bacon D., Cheng P., Rajan, V.. - Presents two algorithms treating garbage collection (tracing and reference counting) and shows that all high-performance garbage collectors can be expressed in terms of those algorithms. [BibLaTex](./assets/unified_garbage_collection.bib).
