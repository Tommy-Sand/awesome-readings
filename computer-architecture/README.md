# Computer Architecture Reading List

This reading list comprises a whole bunch of readings for computer architecture topics. Doubtless, as with the other topics in this repo, there are more in-depth reading lists available for many of the topics discussed here and if you find one, you should link it! Major focuses of this page include:
- Microarchitecture
    - Branch Predictors
    - Memory Systems
    - Caches
    - Coherence Systems
- Simulators for Computer Architecture
- Accelerator Design

Naturally, there will be overlap between this list and many other lists, so cross-references are encouraged.
