	title = {Magazines and Vmem: Extending the Slab Allocator to Many {CPUs} and Arbitrary Resources},
	abstract = {The slab allocator [Bonwick94] provides efficient object caching but has two significant limitations: its global locking doesn’t scale to many {CPUs}, and the allocator can’t manage resources other than kernel memory. To provide scalability we introduce a per−processor caching scheme called the magazine layer that provides linear scaling to any number of {CPUs}. To support more general resource allocation we introduce a new virtual memory allocator, vmem, which acts as a universal backing store for the slab allocator. Vmem is a complete general−purpose resource allocator in its own right, providing several important new services; it also appears to be the first resource allocator that can satisfy arbitrary−size allocations in constant time. Magazines and vmem have yielded performance gains exceeding 50\% on system−level benchmarks like {LADDIS} and {SPECweb}99.},
